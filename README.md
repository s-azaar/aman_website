# A M A N Website'

#### THE IMPORTANT NOTES YOU SHOULD KNOW!
1. Added table for the cameras:

    * This table takes the ID  of the user  ****who have this camera****
    * It's worth to know that ID is an ****Object**** not as MYSQL
    * So, when you want to take an info from a user or a camera you should give the query an ****Object****
  
2. To use our website:

   * Install ****IP WEBCAM**** on your Android phone
   * Run the WEBCAM server from your phone
   * As you saw today how I used it, but you should replace ****shot.jpge**** by ****video****
   * EX. ****http://192.168.1.2:8080/video****
   * If you don't have an ****Android phone****, NOP, install the appropriate one on IPHONE, but you should be careful that the app ****can be WORK AS A streaming APP****
