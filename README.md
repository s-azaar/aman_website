#### THE IMPORTANT NOTES YOU SHOULD KNOW!
1. Added table for the cameras:

    * This table takes the ID  of the user  ****who have this camera****
    * It's worth to know that ID is an ****Object**** not as MYSQL
    * So, when you want to take an info from a user or a camera you should give the query an ****Object****
