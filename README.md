Some basic notes:

1- DB is done now!
  1.1 Therefore, you can't access the site without a real pass and user name.
  1.2 Register page is done, so if you want to insert a new record and save it directly in the DB you can do it.
  1.3 You can use this email "BZU@edu.com" and pass "1234" or "12345" to login in.
  
2- Now we have a 403 page if you entered pass or username incorrect.

3- HTML files have been changed.
  3.1 Check the input from the registration page and on the login page if there are any mistakes that will show to the user a message!

4- The only page I didn't work on it is the home page, so you can enter your work in an easy way. Make sure there are no conflicts in our files when you do it.

5- What we have else?
    5.1 Forgot password service, and it's unimportant.
    5.2 So, our work now on the home page, so let me see what you have done to work with you on it on Thursday; cuz I'm busy now on the BUSA.
